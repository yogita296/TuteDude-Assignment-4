# TuteDude-Assignment-4
This repository contains my submission for the Python course Assignment 4 from Tutedude. It includes two Python scripts that solve the given problems.

---

### Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors

This Python program:

- Opens and reads a text file named `sample.txt`
- Prints its content line by line
- Handles errors gracefully if the file does not exist

---

### Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File

This Python program:

- Takes user input and writes it to a file named `output.txt`
- Appends additional data to the same file
- Reads and displays the final content of the file

### üíª How to Run the Programs (Using PyCharm or Any IDE)

1. Open this project in your preferred Python IDE (e.g., PyCharm, VS Code).
2. Locate the files `Task_1.py` and `Task_2.py` in the project explorer.
3. Right-click on the file you want to run and select **Run**.
4. Follow the input/output shown in the terminal or console.

üìÅ **Notes:**  
- Make sure `sample.txt` is present in the same directory as the Python files before running **Task 1**, or else you'll see an error message.  
- For **Task 2**, `output.txt` will be created automatically if it doesn't exist. Ensure you have write permissions in the project directory.
